# Event-Tracking App – Portfolio Reflection

## Summary of Requirements and Goals
The objective of this project was to create a mobile application that assists users in effectively managing and tracking their upcoming events. The app was crafted to fulfill the demand for a straightforward and dependable method to add, view, edit, and delete events, as well as to receive reminders—making it beneficial for students, professionals, and anyone aiming to stay organized.

## User Needs and UI Design
To cater to user requirements, I incorporated screens for login/registration, an event list, and event creation/editing. The user interface was designed with clarity and user-friendliness as priorities: navigation is simple, and all actions (such as adding or editing events) can be performed with minimal steps. I adhered to Android Material Design principles and conducted tests on the interface to confirm it was intuitive and responsive.

## Coding Approach and Strategies
I divided the project into modules: authentication, database management, and UI components. I employed clear naming conventions and included comments to enhance the readability and maintainability of the code. Additionally, I ensured that permissions and errors were handled smoothly. These strategies helped me maintain organization and can be utilized in future projects for improved structure and reliability.

## Testing and Importance
I conducted tests on the app using the Android emulator, verifying all features (login, event CRUD, permissions) and addressing both expected and edge cases. This process was vital for identifying bugs early and confirming that the app functioned as intended. It highlighted the significance of comprehensive testing, particularly for user authentication and data persistence.

## Innovation and Challenges
One of the challenges I faced was managing permissions (such as SMS) and ensuring the app operated seamlessly regardless of whether the user granted them. I had to innovate by designing the app to degrade gracefully—if SMS permission is not granted, the app continues to function fully, except for SMS notifications.

## Demonstrated Knowledge and Skills
I was especially successful in executing the event CRUD operations and ensuring persistent database storage. This aspect demonstrates my understanding of the necessary skills and knowledge required for this project.
